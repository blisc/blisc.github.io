					<h3 id = "Project-Processor">Processor</h3>
					<h5> A lab project as part of my Computer Organization class. I thoroughly enjoyed it as it was
					my first major verilog project and required conceptualizing the entire processor as a system. We were
					given a barebones single cycle processor with an ALU, register file, and memory system. We converted
					it to a multicycle, pipleined processor.</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Created and designed the data path and control signals of a multicycle, pipelined RISC processor</li>
						<li>Correctly handles control and data hazards using bubbles and bypass wires respectively</li>
						<li>One of the 7 fastest processor designs of the class</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 id = "Project-Robot">The Royal Throne</h3>
					<h5> A design project for a robotics class in second year. We were asked to design and build an autonomous
					robot that would check the state of an <a href="http://www.ufo-toollight.com/">UFO Tool Light</a>. The 
					machine had to turn on the Tool Light, check how many of the LEDs were functioning, and then turn them
					off. Our machine successively checked the state of 9 Tool Lights in one operation.</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Created an autonomous machine that checked the state of LEDs on an UFO Tool Light</li>
						<li>Programmed the PIC microcontroller and interfaced with the circuits</li>
						<li>Designed a simple text user interface and developed the logic and control sequences</li>
						<li>Determined the state of LEDs from the analog readings of 6 photoresistors</li>
						<li>Allowed for the storage of previous test logs to the PIC EEPROM</li>

					<h3 id = "Activities-HA">Hacker Academy</h3>
					<h5>A club within UofT that offers weekly talks about different programming ideas 
					and the latest tools. I have attended the club since first year and enjoyed their
					talks and dev competitions.</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Participated in many of their Hackathons in groups of 2 or less</li>
						<li>Achieved third place in the first Hackathon attended</li>
						<li>Participated in their 2013 Windows Phone Hackathon and created a simple Payment Tracker App for Windows Phone 7.8</li>
						<li>Attended Hacker Academy talks to learn additional topics outside of the classroom</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 id = "Activities-UTDev">UofTDev</h3>
					<h5> A club within UofT that aims to connect student developers together to create apps.
					I have recently joined the club this year and look forward to continue contributing
					to the projects.</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Collaborated with other students to brainstorm many app ideas to be created</li>
						<li>Created a simple web app demo that searches Flickr photos given a keyword and displays one of the results</li>

					<h5> I worked as a Sony Selects Campus Ambassador for the Fall 2013 semester form September
					to December 2013. My job was to promote and demonstrate the Sony Vaio Pro 13 and other Sony
					products to fellow students.</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Promoted the Sony brand and experience across the UofT campus for the 2013 Fall semester</li>
						<li>Gave hands on trials and demonstrations of the latest Sony products</li>
						<li>Assisted Hacker Academy with their second Hackathon in the 2013 school year</li>
						<li>Organized many events across campus that promoted Sony and their products</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Set up and helped with various University events such as convocation and Spring Reunion</li>
						<li>Suggested a better way of entering new graduate emails into the alumni database</li>
						<li>Ensured the guests had a pleasant experience and enjoyed the full extent of the event</li>
